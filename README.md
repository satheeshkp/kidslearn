opencv and tensorflowlite sample codes

I created this repository for making samples of opencv and tensorflowlite in android
It consist of samples for the following

1. Image classifier using tensorflowlite
2. Color detector using opencv - HSV color space
3. Color tracker using opencv - HSV color space
4. Motion detection using opencv - BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 api
5. Handwritten number recognition using tensorflowlite  - model trained using MNIST dataset
6. Shape detection and text to speach using opencv - Contours 
7. I'm working on Invisible cloak project . I will add that soon
